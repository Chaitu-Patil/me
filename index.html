        <h2>Mathematics</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy mathematics for its emphasis on logical reasoning and deep understanding. Proof-based problems and competitions have taught me to refine ideas carefully and persist through challenging questions. For me, mathematics is a way to explore patterns and develop precise, structured thinking.

        <h2>Science & Research</h2>
        <p>
          I am drawn to scientific research because it allows me to turn curiosity into evidence-based understanding. Through science fairs and independent projects, I enjoy designing experiments, analyzing results, and refining ideas through iteration. Research has taught me to think critically, question assumptions, and apply scientific reasoning to real-world problems.

        <h2>Public Speaking</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy public speaking as a way to communicate ideas clearly and connect with diverse audiences. Through competitive and club speaking, I have learned to structure arguments thoughtfully, adapt to feedback, and speak with confidence and purpose. Public speaking has strengthened my ability to explain complex ideas and engage others with clarity and intent.
